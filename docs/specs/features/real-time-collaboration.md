## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** Real-Time Collaboration

**Feature Description:** WebSocket-based real-time synchronization of task updates, comments, and activity across all connected workspace members. Ensures instant visibility of changes without manual refresh.

**Priority:** High

**Goal:** Provide seamless, instant updates to all workspace members for improved collaboration.

**Dependencies:** Task Management, Workspace Management

## 2. Functional Requirements (User Behaviors)

```gherkin
Feature: Real-Time Collaboration

Scenario: Real-Time Task Update
  Given User A and User B are viewing the same task list
  When User A creates a new task "Deploy to production"
  Then User B sees the new task appear instantly
  And User B sees "Created by User A" indicator
  And no page refresh is required

Scenario: Real-Time Status Change
  Given User A and User B are viewing task "Review PR #123"
  When User A marks the task as complete
  Then User B sees the task status update to "Completed" instantly
  And User B sees completion animation/indicator

Scenario: Real-Time Assignment Notification
  Given User A is viewing their dashboard
  When User B assigns a task to User A
  Then User A sees a real-time notification
  And the task appears in User A's "Assigned to Me" list instantly
  And a notification sound plays (if enabled)

Scenario: Concurrent Edit Conflict
  Given User A and User B are editing the same task
  When both users make changes simultaneously
  Then the system detects the conflict
  And the second save shows a "Task was updated by another user" warning
  And the user can review changes and resolve conflict

Scenario: Online Presence Indicators
  Given multiple users are in the same workspace
  When I view the member list
  Then I see green dots next to online users
  And I see "3 members online" in the workspace header
  And the list updates as users come online/offline
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**WebSocket Implementation:**
- Use Socket.IO or native WebSockets
- Room-based subscriptions (one room per workspace)
- Authentication via JWT token
- Heartbeat/ping-pong for connection health

**Event Types:**
- `task:created` - New task created
- `task:updated` - Task details changed
- `task:deleted` - Task removed
- `task:assigned` - Task assigned to user(s)
- `task:completed` - Task marked complete
- `comment:created` - New comment added
- `member:joined` - User joined workspace
- `member:left` - User left workspace
- `presence:update` - Online status changed

**Message Format:**
```typescript
{
  event: 'task:created',
  workspaceId: 'uuid',
  data: {
    task: { id, title, status, ... },
    actor: { id, name, avatarUrl }
  },
  timestamp: '2025-10-03T12:00:00.000Z'
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/workspaces/:id/events/history` - Get recent events (for reconnection)

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **OnlineIndicator**: Green dot for online users
- **RealtimeNotification**: Toast/banner for real-time updates
- **ConflictResolver**: Modal for handling edit conflicts
- **ActivityPulse**: Visual feedback for updates

**State Management:**
- WebSocket connection state
- Online users list
- Pending optimistic updates
- Conflict detection and resolution

**Connection Handling:**
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Sync missed events on reconnect
- Offline mode with queue
- Exponential backoff for reconnection

### 3.3 Database Design

**Event Log Table (optional, for history):**
- `id` (UUID)
- `workspace_id` (UUID)
- `event_type` (VARCHAR)
- `entity_type` (VARCHAR: 'task', 'comment')
- `entity_id` (UUID)
- `user_id` (UUID)
- `payload` (JSONB)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**Indexes:**
- `idx_events_workspace_created` - Recent events per workspace

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Multi-User Real-Time Updates
1. Open app in two browsers as different users
2. Create task in browser A
3. Verify instant appearance in browser B
4. Edit task in browser B
5. Verify changes visible in browser A

**Expected Result:** All actions synchronized instantly (< 500ms).

### Test Case 2: Network Interruption
1. User is viewing task list
2. Disconnect network
3. Create tasks (should queue)
4. Reconnect network
5. Verify queued tasks sync

**Expected Result:** Graceful offline handling, successful sync on reconnect.

### Test Case 3: Concurrent Edits
1. Two users edit same task simultaneously
2. First saves successfully
3. Second sees conflict warning
4. User resolves conflict

**Expected Result:** Conflict detected and resolved without data loss.

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Set up WebSocket server (Socket.IO)
- [ ] Implement room-based subscriptions
- [ ] Add JWT authentication for WS
- [ ] Implement event broadcasting
- [ ] Add event history endpoint
- [ ] Implement presence tracking
- [ ] Write tests for WebSocket events

### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create WebSocket client wrapper
- [ ] Implement auto-reconnect logic
- [ ] Create event handlers for each event type
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add conflict detection
- [ ] Create ConflictResolver component
- [ ] Add online presence indicators
- [ ] Implement offline queue
- [ ] Test with multiple users

## 6. Success Metrics

- Real-time update latency: < 500ms (p95)
- WebSocket uptime: > 99.5%
- Conflict rate: < 1% of all edits
- User satisfaction with real-time features: > 9 NPS

## 7. Future Enhancements

- Operational transformation for true collaborative editing
- See who's viewing/editing a task
- User cursor positions (collaborative mode)
- Undo/redo across users
- Change history and playback
