## 2. Functional Requirements (User Behaviors)

```gherkin
Feature: Core Task Management

Scenario: Create New Task
  Given I am logged in as a team member
  And I am on the dashboard
  When I click "Add Task" button
  And I enter task title "Prepare Q4 presentation"
  And I enter description "Create slides for quarterly review"

  Given I have created a task "Review pull request"
  When I click "Assign"
  And I select user "john@example.com" from workspace roster
  And I click "Assign Task"
  Then the task is assigned to John
  And John receives a notification about the assignment
  And the task appears in John's "Assigned to Me" list

Scenario: Assign Task to Multiple Team Members
  Given I have created a task "Brainstorm marketing campaign"
  When I click "Assign"
  And I select multiple users: "sarah@example.com", "mike@example.com"
  And I click "Assign Task"
  Then the task is assigned to both Sarah and Mike
  And both users receive notifications
  And the task shows "2 assignees"

Scenario: Mark Task as Complete
  Given I have a task "Write unit tests" assigned to me
  And the task status is "In Progress"
  When I click the checkbox next to the task
  Then the task status changes to "Completed"
  And the task creator receives a notification
  And the task moves to "Completed" section
  And the completion timestamp is recorded

Scenario: Reopen Completed Task
  Given I have a completed task "Fix login bug"
  When I click "Reopen Task"
  Then the task status changes back to "In Progress"
  And the task returns to active task list
  And team members are notified of the status change

Scenario: Delete Task
  Given I have created a task "Old placeholder task"
  And the task has no assignees
  When I click "Delete Task"
  And I confirm the deletion
  Then the task is permanently deleted
  And it disappears from all views

Scenario: Reassign Task
  Given a task "Update documentation" is assigned to me
  When I click "Reassign"
  And I select "emma@example.com"
  And I click "Confirm"
  Then the task is reassigned to Emma
  And Emma receives a notification
  And the task is removed from my assigned list
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**Database Schema:**
- **tasks** table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `workspace_id` (UUID, foreign key)
  - `title` (VARCHAR, 255)
  - `description` (TEXT, nullable)
  - `status` (ENUM: 'todo', 'in_progress', 'completed')
  - `priority` (ENUM: 'low', 'medium', 'high')
  - `due_date` (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
  - `created_by` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `completed_at` (TIMESTAMP, nullable)

- **task_assignments** table (many-to-many):
  - `id` (UUID)
  - `task_id` (UUID, foreign key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key)
  - `assigned_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create task
- `GET /api/tasks` - List tasks (with filters)
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get task details
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/assign` - Assign task to user(s)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/complete` - Mark as complete
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/reopen` - Reopen completed task

**Validation:**
- Title: required, 1-255 characters
- Description: optional, max 5000 characters
- Status: must be valid enum value
- Priority: must be valid enum value
- Due date: must be future date
- Assignees: must be valid workspace members

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **TaskList**: Display tasks in list/card view
- **TaskForm**: Create/edit task form with validation
- **TaskCard**: Individual task display with actions
- **TaskModal**: Detailed task view
- **AssigneeSelector**: Multi-select user picker
- **PriorityBadge**: Visual priority indicator
- **StatusIndicator**: Task status display

**State Management:**
- Task list state in context/store
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error rollback on failure

**Associated Behavior:**
- Auto-save draft tasks (localStorage)
- Drag-and-drop task reordering
- Keyboard shortcuts (n for new task, e for edit)
- Bulk actions (select multiple, bulk assign)

### 3.3 Database Design

**Indexes:**
- `idx_tasks_workspace_id` - Filter by workspace
- `idx_tasks_status` - Filter by status
- `idx_tasks_due_date` - Sort by due date
- `idx_tasks_created_by` - Filter by creator
- `idx_task_assignments_user_id` - Filter by assignee
- `idx_task_assignments_task_id` - Join with tasks

**Relationships:**
- tasks → workspaces (many-to-one)
- tasks → users (many-to-one, creator)
- tasks ↔ users (many-to-many, assignees)

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Complete Task Lifecycle
1. Create new task with all fields
2. Verify task appears in list
3. Edit task details
4. Verify changes saved and visible
5. Assign to team member
6. Verify notification sent
7. Mark as complete
8. Verify status updated

**Expected Result:** Task moves through lifecycle smoothly, all actions persist, notifications sent.

### Test Case 2: Multi-User Task Assignment
1. Create task as user A
2. Assign to users B and C
3. Verify both see task in their "Assigned to Me" list
4. User B completes task
5. Verify all users see completion

**Expected Result:** Multi-user assignment works, real-time updates visible to all.

### Test Case 3: Task Validation
1. Attempt to create task with empty title
2. Verify error message shown
3. Attempt to assign to non-workspace member
4. Verify error message shown
5. Attempt to set past due date
6. Verify warning or error shown

**Expected Result:** Proper validation prevents invalid operations.
