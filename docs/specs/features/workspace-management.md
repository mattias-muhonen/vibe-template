## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** Workspace Management

**Feature Description:** Multi-user workspace creation and management with role-based permissions. Enables teams to create shared workspaces, invite members, and manage access control. Integrates with the authentication system for secure multi-user collaboration.

**Priority:** Medium (but foundational - needed for multi-user features)

**Goal:** Enable secure, scalable workspace management with clear role-based access control.

## 2. Functional Requirements (User Behaviors)

```gherkin
Feature: Workspace Management

Scenario: Create New Workspace
  Given I am a logged-in user
  And I have no existing workspaces
  When I click "Create Workspace"
  And I enter workspace name "Marketing Team"
  And I enter description "Workspace for marketing campaigns"
  And I click "Create"
  Then a new workspace is created
  And I am assigned as Admin role
  And I am redirected to the workspace dashboard

Scenario: Invite User to Workspace
  Given I am an Admin of workspace "Development Team"
  When I click "Invite Member"
  And I enter email "newdev@example.com"
  And I select role "Member"
  And I click "Send Invitation"
  Then an invitation email is sent to the user
  And the invitation is recorded as "Pending"
  And I see the pending invitation in the members list

Scenario: Accept Workspace Invitation
  Given I received an invitation email for workspace "Sales Team"
  When I click the invitation link
  And I am logged in or I log in
  Then I am added to the workspace
  And my role is set to "Member"
  And I can access the workspace dashboard
  And I see all workspace tasks

Scenario: Update User Role
  Given I am an Admin of workspace "Operations"
  And user "john@example.com" is a Member
  When I click on John's profile
  And I change role from "Member" to "Admin"
  And I click "Save"
  Then John's role is updated to Admin
  And John receives a notification about the role change
  And John gains admin privileges

Scenario: Remove User from Workspace
  Given I am an Admin of workspace "Design Team"
  And user "former@example.com" is a Member
  When I click "Remove from Workspace"
  And I confirm the removal
  Then the user is removed from the workspace
  And the user loses access to all workspace tasks
  And tasks assigned to them are unassigned
  And the user receives a notification

Scenario: Leave Workspace
  Given I am a Member of workspace "Project Alpha"
  And I am not the only Admin
  When I click "Leave Workspace"
  And I confirm I want to leave
  Then I am removed from the workspace
  And I lose access to workspace tasks
  And my assignments are removed

Scenario: Switch Between Workspaces
  Given I am a member of multiple workspaces: "Marketing", "Development"
  When I click the workspace switcher
  And I select "Development"
  Then I am switched to the Development workspace
  And I see only tasks from that workspace
  And the workspace name is displayed in the header
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**Database Schema:**

- **workspaces** table:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (VARCHAR, 255)
  - `description` (TEXT, nullable)
  - `created_by` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

- **workspace_members** table:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `workspace_id` (UUID, foreign key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key)
  - `role` (ENUM: 'admin', 'member')
  - `joined_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - UNIQUE constraint on (workspace_id, user_id)

- **workspace_invitations** table:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `workspace_id` (UUID, foreign key)
  - `email` (VARCHAR, 255)
  - `role` (ENUM: 'admin', 'member')
  - `token` (VARCHAR, 255, unique)
  - `invited_by` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `status` (ENUM: 'pending', 'accepted', 'expired')
  - `expires_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/workspaces` - Create workspace
- `GET /api/workspaces` - List user's workspaces
- `GET /api/workspaces/:id` - Get workspace details
- `PUT /api/workspaces/:id` - Update workspace
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id` - Delete workspace
- `POST /api/workspaces/:id/invite` - Invite user
- `POST /api/workspaces/:id/accept-invite` - Accept invitation
- `PUT /api/workspaces/:id/members/:userId` - Update member role
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/members/:userId` - Remove member
- `POST /api/workspaces/:id/leave` - Leave workspace

**Authorization Rules:**
- Only Admin can invite members
- Only Admin can change roles
- Only Admin can remove members
- Members can leave (unless last admin)
- Only workspace creator can delete workspace
- Users can only access workspaces they're members of

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **WorkspaceSelector**: Dropdown to switch workspaces
- **WorkspaceSettings**: Admin panel for workspace config
- **MemberList**: Display workspace members with roles
- **InviteMemberModal**: Form to invite new members
- **WorkspaceCreateForm**: Create new workspace
- **RoleManager**: Change member roles (admin only)

**State Management:**
- Current workspace ID in context
- Workspace list in context
- Member list per workspace
- User's role in current workspace

### 3.3 Database Design

**Indexes:**
- `idx_workspaces_created_by` - Filter by creator
- `idx_workspace_members_user_id` - Find user's workspaces
- `idx_workspace_members_workspace_id` - Get workspace members
- `idx_workspace_invitations_email` - Find pending invites by email
- `idx_workspace_invitations_token` - Accept invitation lookup

**Constraints:**
- Workspace name required
- At least one Admin per workspace (prevent removing last admin)
- Cannot invite existing member
- Cannot remove yourself if you're the last admin

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Complete Workspace Setup
1. Create new workspace
2. Invite 3 members (2 regular, 1 admin)
3. Verify invitations sent
4. Accept invitations
5. Verify all members see workspace

**Expected Result:** Workspace created, invitations work, members have correct access.

### Test Case 2: Role Management
1. Admin changes member to admin
2. New admin invites another member
3. Verify new admin has proper permissions
4. Original admin demotes new admin to member
5. Verify permissions updated

**Expected Result:** Role changes work correctly, permissions enforced.

### Test Case 3: Workspace Isolation
1. Create two workspaces
2. Add different members to each
3. Create tasks in each workspace
4. Verify members only see their workspace tasks
5. Switch between workspaces

**Expected Result:** Complete workspace isolation, no data leakage.
