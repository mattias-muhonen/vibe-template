## 2. Functional Requirements (User Behaviors)

```gherkin
Feature: Task Filtering & Sorting

Scenario: Filter by Assignee
  Given I have tasks assigned to different users
  When I select "Filter by Assignee"
  And I select "John Doe"
  Then I see only tasks assigned to John
  And task count updates to show filtered count

Scenario: Filter by Status
  Given I have tasks in various statuses
  When I select "Show: Completed"
  Then I see only completed tasks
  And incomplete tasks are hidden

Scenario: Filter by Due Date
  Given I have tasks with different due dates
  When I select "Due: This Week"
  Then I see only tasks due within 7 days
  And overdue tasks are highlighted

Scenario: Filter by Priority
  Given I have tasks with different priorities
  When I select "Priority: High"
  Then I see only high-priority tasks
  And they are highlighted appropriately

Scenario: Combine Multiple Filters
  Given I am viewing all tasks
  When I select "Assigned to: Me" AND "Status: In Progress"
  Then I see only my in-progress tasks
  And both filters are indicated in the UI

Scenario: Sort by Due Date
  Given I have multiple tasks
  When I select "Sort by: Due Date"
  Then tasks are ordered by due date (earliest first)
  And overdue tasks appear at the top

Scenario: Sort by Priority
  Given I have multiple tasks
  When I select "Sort by: Priority"
  Then tasks are ordered High → Medium → Low
  And equal priorities maintain their relative order

Scenario: Save Filter Preset
  Given I have applied filters "Status: In Progress" and "Assignee: Me"
  When I click "Save Filter"
  And I name it "My Active Tasks"
  Then the preset is saved
  And appears in "Saved Filters" dropdown

Scenario: Clear All Filters
  Given I have multiple filters applied
  When I click "Clear All Filters"
  Then all filters are removed
  And I see all workspace tasks
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**Query Parameters:**
- `assignee` - UUID or "me" or "unassigned"
- `status` - "todo", "in_progress", "completed"
- `priority` - "low", "medium", "high"
- `due_date` - "overdue", "today", "this_week", "this_month"
- `sort_by` - "due_date", "priority", "created_at", "title"
- `sort_order` - "asc", "desc"

**API Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/tasks?assignee=me&status=in_progress&sort_by=due_date&sort_order=asc`

**Database Query Optimization:**
- Use indexes on filtered/sorted columns
- Implement efficient query building
- Support multiple filters with AND logic
- Return total count and filtered count

**Filter Presets (optional):**
- Store user's saved filter combinations
- Table: `filter_presets` (user_id, name, filters_json)

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **FilterBar**: Horizontal bar with filter dropdowns
- **FilterChip**: Individual filter indicator (removable)
- **SortSelector**: Dropdown for sort options
- **SavedFilters**: Dropdown of user's presets
- **FilterBadge**: Visual indicator of active filters

**State Management:**
- Active filters in context/URL params
- Sort preferences
- Saved presets
- Debounce filter changes (300ms)

**URL Sync:**
- Filters reflected in URL query params
- Shareable filtered URLs
- Browser back/forward support

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Single Filters
1. Apply each filter type individually
2. Verify correct tasks displayed
3. Verify counts accurate
4. Clear filter
5. Verify all tasks returned

**Expected Result:** Each filter works independently and accurately.

### Test Case 2: Combined Filters
1. Apply assignee + status filters
2. Add priority filter
3. Verify only tasks matching all criteria shown
4. Remove one filter
5. Verify results update correctly

**Expected Result:** Multiple filters work together with AND logic.

### Test Case 3: Sorting
1. Sort by each option
2. Verify order correct
3. Combine sort with filters
4. Verify filtered results properly sorted

**Expected Result:** Sorting works with and without filters.
