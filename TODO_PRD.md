* Initial workspace setup (name, invite users) is prompted, but can be skipped or visited later

### Core User Flow

1. **Login** → User authenticates (Google or email/password)
2. **Dashboard** → See tasks assigned to them, prominent "Add Task" button
3. **Create Task** → Simple form: title, description, due date, priority, assignee(s)
4. **Task Appears Instantly** → Real-time sync to all workspace members
5. **Collaborate** → Comment, reassign, update status
6. **Complete** → Mark done, notify creator
7. **Filter/Sort** → Find specific tasks quickly

### UI/UX Principles

* **Minimalist:** Clean, uncluttered interface

## User Narrative

Sarah leads a remote marketing team scattered across three time zones. Previously, they struggled to keep track of responsibilities—tasks were lost in email threads, and deadlines were missed when ownership was unclear.

With the Multi-User Todo Application, Sarah quickly sets up a team workspace and invites everyone to join. She can easily create tasks, assign them to specific team members, and clarify priorities directly in the app.

As each team member logs in, they see only the tasks relevant to them, can comment to request clarifications, and mark work complete when finished. Real-time notifications ensure everyone stays aligned, while overdue or at-risk tasks are surfaced to Sarah for quick action.

**The result?** Sarah's team collaborates far more effectively: accountability is clear, no task slips through the cracks, and the team has more time to focus on creative work—instead of chasing status updates. The business sees improved project turnaround and higher team morale.
